Here's a brief on a website that i'm building. Can you flesh it out with some cool features? Give specific pages in the app and their functionality. I don't want to bloat the app with loads of unnecessary functionality. Give me orthogonal features that can be composed into a really cool user experience

```

Welcome to jotta.ai, a diary that quickly becomes your second brain.

### What is Jotta?

Jotta is a place to record what your daily life. This includes:

- Your day-to-day actions

- People you've talked to

- Thoughts you've had

Over time, Jotta learns about your life, the people you know, and your habits. It's all about recording the important information in your life so that you don't forget what you don't want to forget.

```


## RESPONSE
Below is a lean, modular set of features and pages. Each page stands on its own (orthogonality) but also complements the others when combined—providing a powerful “second brain” without loading you down with unnecessary extras.

---

## 1. **Daily Journal**

**Core Function:** Record day-to-day actions, conversations, and thoughts

- **Quick Capture:** A text box where you can jot down your day’s events, people you met, or random ideas as bullet points or longer-form text.
    
- **Automatic Tagging:** As you type names or keywords, the system automatically tags entries with relevant people or topics.
    
- **Small Delight:** A simple “Start Entry” button each morning that auto-inserts date and time, encouraging a quick journaling habit.
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** This is your basic data input. It’s minimal and doesn’t require heavy structure. Other features can build on these entries, but the act of journaling remains clean and simple.

---

## 2. **People & Connections**

**Core Function:** A living rolodex of people in your life and your interactions with them

- **Auto-Population:** Whenever you mention a new name in your Daily Journal, Jotta creates a “stub” profile for that person.
    
- **Profiles:** Each person’s page shows recent interactions, location of the last meeting (if relevant), shared tags (e.g., “Work,” “Family,” “Gym Buddy”).
    
- **Timeline View:** Each person’s page has a chronological feed of all journal entries that mention them, helping you remember context from past conversations.
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** It directly leverages your journal entries but stays separate from them. You can use Jotta for personal reflection without ever fleshing out the People & Connections page, yet if you do opt in, it automatically enriches your journal with relationship context.

---

## 3. **Search & Knowledge Graph**

**Core Function:** Find connections between journal entries, people, and topics

- **Smart Search:** Type in any keyword or partial phrase. Jotta returns matching entries, plus suggestions of related tags and people.
    
- **Knowledge Graph View (Optional Visualization):** See a web of interconnected people, topics, and dates, highlighting how your daily experiences link together.
    
- **Deep Linking:** Clicking a node (a person, a tag, or a date) filters the entire diary to show only relevant entries.
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** This page does nothing but extract and present data that already exists in your Daily Journal and People pages. It’s a convenience tool for discovering patterns and refreshing your memory, but it doesn’t clutter the core journaling experience if you don’t need it.

---

## 4. **Insights & Reflections**

**Core Function:** Give you periodic summaries and gentle nudges based on your behavior

- **Weekly Review:** Generates a brief recap of the past week (e.g., “You mentioned [Alice] 3 times, mostly around meeting plans.”).
    
- **Automatic Highlights:** Surfaces big milestones, repeated habits, or frequently mentioned emotions (“You’ve mentioned feeling ‘anxious’ 5 times in 2 weeks—do you want to explore why?”).
    
- **Customizable Alerts:** You can enable or disable insights around keywords like “stress,” “breakthrough,” or “travel.”
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** This feature consumes data from your existing entries and connections. It’s purely an analytic layer that can be toggled on or off, so it won’t bloat the user interface if you’re not interested in automatically generated insights.

---

## 5. **Reminders & Follow-Ups**

**Core Function:** Don’t forget tasks or ideas that come up in your journal

- **Flag an Entry:** If you write “I need to follow up with Bob next Tuesday,” you can quickly flag it for a future reminder.
    
- **Adaptive Reminders:** Jotta can detect time-based references (“next week,” “by Friday”) and offer to add a gentle nudge.
    
- **Single Inbox View:** A minimal list of all flagged entries, so you can clear them out or mark them as done.
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** It’s a streamlined to-do feature strictly tied to diary entries. It doesn’t aim to be a full task management system, but provides frictionless follow-ups. You can ignore it if you just want to journal with no tasks.

---

## 6. **Settings & Data Ownership**

**Core Function:** Ensure you have full control over your data

- **Export/Backup:** One-click export of all journal entries and people data into a standard format (like Markdown or CSV).
    
- **Privacy Toggles:** Choose to hide or mask sensitive entries from certain parts of the interface (e.g., hide them from Insights if you want the AI to ignore them).
    
- **Device Sync:** Basic syncing across devices, with end-to-end encryption or password protection so you stay in control.
    

**How it’s Orthogonal:** This page is purely about managing your data, not about the core diary or analytics. If you’re privacy-focused, you’ll appreciate the control; if not, you can just set it and forget it.

# Putting It All Together

**A Day in Jotta:** You open the **Daily Journal** page to jot down notes about your morning meeting with Alice. Jotta automatically tags “Alice,” which is available in the **People & Connections** page. Later, you find yourself searching for “coffee chat” in the **Search & Knowledge Graph** page—Jotta pulls up past coffee chats with Alice. By the weekend, you get a summary in **Insights & Reflections** about how many times you’ve met Alice and potential topics you might’ve repeated. If you promised to send her a document, you flagged it in the **Reminders & Follow-Ups**, so you get a gentle nudge at the right time. Finally, you back everything up in the **Settings & Data Ownership** page to ensure you can always access your second brain in the future.

**Result:** A cohesive, non-bloated user experience where each feature stands on its own but also weaves together to help you remember everything you don’t want to forget.
