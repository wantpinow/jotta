Realtime
Beta
Communicate with a GPT-4o class model in real time using WebRTC or WebSockets. Supports text and audio inputs and ouputs, along with audio transcriptions. Learn more about the Realtime API.

Session tokens
REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral session tokens for use in client-side applications.

Create session
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/sessions
Create an ephemeral API token for use in client-side applications with the Realtime API. Can be configured with the same session parameters as the session.update client event.

It responds with a session object, plus a client_secret key which contains a usable ephemeral API token that can be used to authenticate browser clients for the Realtime API.

Request body
input_audio_format
string

Optional
Defaults to pcm16
The format of input audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw. For pcm16, input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 24kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order.

input_audio_noise_reduction
object

Optional
Defaults to null
Configuration for input audio noise reduction. This can be set to null to turn off. Noise reduction filters audio added to the input audio buffer before it is sent to VAD and the model. Filtering the audio can improve VAD and turn detection accuracy (reducing false positives) and model performance by improving perception of the input audio.


Show properties
input_audio_transcription
object

Optional
Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to null to turn off once on. Input audio transcription is not native to the model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs asynchronously through the /audio/transcriptions endpoint and should be treated as guidance of input audio content rather than precisely what the model heard. The client can optionally set the language and prompt for transcription, these offer additional guidance to the transcription service.


Show properties
instructions
string

Optional
The default system instructions (i.e. system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired behavior.

Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if this field is not set and are visible in the session.created event at the start of the session.

max_response_output_tokens
integer or "inf"

Optional
Maximum number of output tokens for a single assistant response, inclusive of tool calls. Provide an integer between 1 and 4096 to limit output tokens, or inf for the maximum available tokens for a given model. Defaults to inf.

modalities
Optional
The set of modalities the model can respond with. To disable audio, set this to ["text"].

model
string

Optional
The Realtime model used for this session.

output_audio_format
string

Optional
Defaults to pcm16
The format of output audio. Options are pcm16, g711_ulaw, or g711_alaw. For pcm16, output audio is sampled at a rate of 24kHz.

temperature
number

Optional
Defaults to 0.8
Sampling temperature for the model, limited to [0.6, 1.2]. For audio models a temperature of 0.8 is highly recommended for best performance.

tool_choice
string

Optional
Defaults to auto
How the model chooses tools. Options are auto, none, required, or specify a function.

tools
array

Optional
Tools (functions) available to the model.


Show properties
turn_detection
object

Optional
Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to null to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response. Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech. Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.


Show properties
voice
string

Optional
The voice the model uses to respond. Voice cannot be changed during the session once the model has responded with audio at least once. Current voice options are alloy, ash, ballad, coral, echo, fable, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, and verse.

Client events
These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

session.update
Send this event to update the session’s default configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field, except for voice. However, note that once a session has been initialized with a particular model, it can’t be changed to another model using session.update.

When the server receives a session.update, it will respond with a session.updated event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present are updated. To clear a field like instructions, pass an empty string.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

    }
}
input_audio_buffer.append
Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. In Server VAD mode, the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike made other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.

audio
string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the input_audio_format field in the session configuration.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.append.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.append
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
input_audio_buffer.commit
Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.committed event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.commit.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit
{
    "event_id": "event_789",

input_audio_buffer.clear
Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.cleared event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.clear.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear

}
conversation.item.create
Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.created event, otherwise an error event will be sent.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item
object

The item to add to the conversation.


Show properties
previous_item_id
string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to root, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.create.

OBJECT conversation.item.create

            }
        ]
    }
}
conversation.item.truncate
Send this event to truncate a previous assistant message’s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.truncated event.

audio_end_ms
integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.

content_index
integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

conversation.item.delete
Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a conversation.item.deleted event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id

{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.delete",
    "item_id": "msg_003"
}
response.create
This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history.

The server will respond with a response.created event, events for Items and content created, and finally a response.done event to indicate the Response is complete.

The response.create event includes inference configuration like instructions, and temperature. These fields will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

event_id

    }
}
conversation.item.created
Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that produce this event:

The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce either one or two Items, which will be of type message (role assistant) or type function_call.
The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the server (in server_vad mode). The server will take the content of the input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.
The client has sent a conversation.item.create event to add a new Item to the Conversation.
event_id

        "role": "user",
        "content": []
    }
}
conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in server_vad mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, currently always whisper-1. Thus the transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

}
conversation.item.truncated
Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the client with a conversation.item.truncate event. This event is used to synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

This action will truncate the audio and remove the server-side text transcript to ensure there is no text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

audio_end_ms

input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).
